# Principal Components Analysis in node or the browser

A JS library to compute Principal Components from a given matrix of data. Use in either node.js or the browser.

Use by accessing the singleton PCA, and by the methods as described below.

## How to use the API

All methods are exposed through `PCA` global variable

Say you have data for marks of a class 4 students in 3 examinations on the same subject:

```
Student 1: 40,50,60
Student 2: 50,70,60
Student 3: 80,70,90
Student 4: 50,60,80
```

You want to examine whether it is possible to come up with a single descriptive set of scores which explains performance across the class. Alternatively, whether it would make sense to replace 3 exams with just one (and reduce stress on students).


First get the set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues (principal components and adjusted loadings)
```js
var data = [[40,50,60],[50,70,60],[80,70,90],[50,60,80]];
var vectors = PCA.getEigenVectors(data);
//Outputs 
// [{
//     "eigenvalue": 520.0992658908312,
//     "vector": [0.744899700771276, 0.2849796479974595, 0.6032503924724023]
// }, {
//     "eigenvalue": 78.10455398035167,
//     "vector": [0.2313199078283626, 0.7377809866160473, -0.6341689964277106]
// }, {
//     "eigenvalue": 18.462846795484058,
//     "vector": [0.6257919271076777, -0.6119361208615616, -0.4836513702572988]
// }]
```

Now you'd need to find a set of eigenvectors that would explain a decent amount of variance across your exams (thus telling you if 1 test or 2 tests would suffice instead of three)

```js
var first = PCA.computePercentageExplained(vectors,vectors[0])
// 0.8434042149581044
var topTwo = PCA.computePercentageExplained(vectors,vectors[0],vectors[1])
// 0.9700602484397556
```

So if you wanted to have 97% certainty, that someone wouldn't just flunk out accidentally, you'd take 2 exams. But let's say you just wanted to take 1, explaining 84% of variance is good enough. And instead of taking the examination again, you just wanted a normalized score

```js
var adData = PCA.computeAdjustedData(data,vectors[0])
// {
//     "adjustedData": [
//         [-22.27637101744241, -9.127781049780463, 31.316721747529886, 0.08743031969298887]
//     ],
//     "formattedAdjustedData": [
//         [-22.28, -9.13, 31.32, 0.09]
//     ],
//     "avgData": [
//         [-55, -62.5, -72.5],
//         [-55, -62.5, -72.5],
//         [-55, -62.5, -72.5],
//         [-55, -62.5, -72.5]
//     ],
//     "selectedVectors": [
//         [0.744899700771276, 0.2849796479974595, 0.6032503924724023]
//     ]
// }
```

The adjustedData is centered (mean = 0), but you could always set the mean to something like 50, to get scores of `[-22.27637101744241, -9.127781049780463, 31.316721747529886, 0.08743031969298887].map(score=>Math.round(score+50))` equal to `[28, 41, 81, 50]` , and that's how well your students would have done, in the order of students.

### Other cool stuff that's possible

#### Compression (lossy):
```js
var compressed = adData.formattedAdjustedData;
//[
//         [-22.28, -9.13, 31.32, 0.09]
//     ]
var uncompressed = PCA.computeOriginalData(compressed,adData.selectedVectors,adData.avgData);
//uncompressed.formattedOriginalData (lossy since 2 eigenvectors are removed)
// [
//     [38.4, 56.15, 59.06],
//     [48.2, 59.9, 66.99],
//     [78.33, 71.43, 91.39],
//     [55.07, 62.53, 72.55]
// ]
```

Compare this to the original data to understand just how lossy the compression was
```
//Original Data
[
    [40, 50, 60],
    [50, 70, 60],
    [80, 70, 90],
    [50, 60, 80]
]
//Uncompressed Data
[
    [38.4, 56.15, 59.06],
    [48.2, 59.9, 66.99],
    [78.33, 71.43, 91.39],
    [55.07, 62.53, 72.55]
]
```
