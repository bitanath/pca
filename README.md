# Principal Components Analysis in the browser

A library to compute Principal Components from a given matrix of data.

Use the global PCA object to compute stuff.

## Samples

Determine the deviation matrix from data (Data-mean)
```js
var matrix = PCA.computeDeviationMatrix([[1,2,3],[2,5,4],[3,4,6]]);
```

Then calculate the deviation sum of squares and variance covariance matrix from this 

```js
var C = PCA.computeVarianceCovariance(PCA.computeDeviationScores(matrix),false); //compute variance for population and not sample
```

Then, calculate the eigenvectors and use it to compute adjusted data from the reduced eigenvectors. Eliminate low variance explaining vectors and feed it into the function to generate the final, adjusted dataset.

```js
var vectors = PCA.computeSVD(C); //returns [{eigenvalue:n,vector:[array]}]
var adjustedData = PCA.computeAdjustedData([[1,2,3],[2,5,4],[3,4,6]],vectors[0].vector,vectors[1].vector); //select the first 2 principal components
```

Finally, in case you want to skip all these steps, and simply get the principal component, or select the first principal component alone:

```js
var vectors = PCA.getEigenVectors([[1,2,3],[2,5,4],[3,4,6]]); //Get top eigenvectors

var adjustedData = PCA.analyseTopResult([[1,2,3],[2,5,4],[3,4,6]]); //Get adjusted data using only the first eigenvector
```
